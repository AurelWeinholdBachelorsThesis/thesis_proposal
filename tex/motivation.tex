\section{Motivation}

As industrial factories become larger and more connected, the demand for a
decentralized distributed system consisting of sensors, controllers and
compute-nodes grows larger over time. This describes the Industrial Internet of
Things (IIoT), an umbrella term for networks consisting of many small devices,
such as sensors or robots, possibly connected, coordinated and controlled by a
cloud.

As these individual IIoT networks grow, more and more resources are needed for
the networking, as well as the controlling component. To help reduce this, edge
computing, a new paradigm in distributed systems, has introduced the idea to
(pre-)compute \enquote{on the edge} of the cloud, which might significantly
reduce stress on the network and on the compute-resources of the cloud itself.
