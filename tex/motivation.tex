\section{Motivation}

% IIoT
As industrial factories become larger and more connected, the demand for a
decentralized distributed system consisting of sensors, controllers and
compute-nodes grows larger.

The Industrial Internet of Things, as defined by
\citeauthor{boyes_industrial_2018}, is the aggregation of networked sensors and
actuators with optional cloud or edge computing platforms which enable real
time, intelligent, and autonomous access, collection, analysis, and
communications, of process, product and service information, within the
industrial environment~\cite{boyes_industrial_2018}. In this context
\enquote{industrial} refers to manufacturing and excludes mining, construction
and energy~\cite{noauthor_industry_nodate}.

% real-time
Some of these sensors and actuators also exhibit real-time behavior, to ensure
safety and Quality of Service (QoS). Real-time operation is defined by DIN 44300
to be the operation of a computer system with programs that are at any time
ready to process data in a way that the computational results are available
within a given period of time. This is necessary as these actors interact with
the real world, being in physical contact with each other and possible even
humans. To mitigate risk for human workers and to ensure QoS in the product it
is strictly necessary to be dependable, as a violation might cost millions or
potentially the lives of humans.

% edge
As latencies in unknown networks are unpredictable a shift away from the cloud
towards the IIoT networks has been made. This edge computing, a new paradigm in
distributed systems, has introduced the idea to (pre-)compute \enquote{on the
edge} of the cloud~\cite{shi_edge_2016}, which significantly reduces response
times by avoiding these network latencies, all the while also reducing stress on
networks to and from the cloud and the computing resources of the cloud.

%\todo{Is global market actually IIoT? Is this relevant?}
%According to \citeauthor{placek_industrial_nodate} the global market for IIoT is
%expected to grow almost five-fold up to 2028~\cite{placek_industrial_nodate} and
%with it there will be an increase in demand for networking and controlling
%resources. To combat this fast increase, edge computing, a new paradigm in
%distributed systems, has introduced the idea to (pre-)compute \enquote{on the
%edge} of the cloud~\cite{shi_edge_2016}, which significantly reduces stress on
%the network and on the compute-resources of the cloud itself, while also
%allowing for faster response times by avoiding congested
%networks~\cite{shi_edge_2016}.
