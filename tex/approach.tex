% How is eBPF used? What can be achieved?
Traditional usage of classic Berkeley Packet Filter (cBPF) was limited to
network applications, hooking into the traffic control (TC) stage of the linux
kernel network stack or the eXpress Data Path (XDP) to allow inspection and
filtering of packets early on in the pipeline. Although limited it opened to
door into advanced network level monitoring on the kernel level.

Only with its extension to eBPF in recent years, researchers have tried to use
it for more advanced network related tasks~\cite{miano_creating_2018} and even
other applications hooking into systemcalls.

This thesis explores the possibilities in enhancing near real-time behavior by
using and abusing(?) eBPF on the edge of an IIoT network to select tasks based
on a priority model and the load of the edge device.
