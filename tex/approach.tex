\section{Approach}


% How is eBPF used? What can be achieved?
Traditional usage of Berkeley Packet Filter was limited to network applications,
hooking into the traffic control (TC) stage of the linux kernel network stack,
the eXpress Data Path (XDP) or others(?) to allow inspection and filtering of
packets early on in the pipeline. eBPF also allows to hook into other(?)
syscalls widening the range of applications to.. .
\todo{to what? Rewrite. Cite "Complex Complex Network Services with eBPF:
Experiences and Lessons Learned" Miano}

This thesis explores the possibilities in speeding up and enhancing near real
time behavior by using and abusing(?) eBPF on the edge of an IIoT network to select
tasks based on a priority model and the load of the edge device.
