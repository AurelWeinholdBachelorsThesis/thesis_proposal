\section{Problem Statement}

% real-time
Even with the computing nodes closer, actors depending on real-time still can
not rely on unpredictable networks but using edge-computing and new technologies
it is possible to get closer to real-time computation. Current research is
mostly focusing on enhancing the network component using novel 5G
technologies~\cite{nunna_enabling_2015} and finding and evaluating new
protocols~\cite{suriyachai_survey_2012}, but research on improving response-time
on the edge node itself is scarce. There still however is potential on the edge
devices in the context of IIoT specifically. Frequently recurring requests, with
responses only depending on internal states or infrequently changing variables
currently require redundant overhead, i.e. context switches, which not only
costs valuable computing power on the edge note, but also unnecessarily delays
response.
